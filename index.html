      <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
      <p>The app follows a modular structure, using Firebase for real-time database management and user authentication. Some of the design patterns include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Observer Pattern:</b> Used to dynamically update the UI when changes occur in the database.</li>
        <li><b>Singleton Pattern:</b> Ensures a single instance of the Firebase database reference is used throughout the app.</li>
        <li><b>Strategy Pattern:</b> Implements flexible layout management for the RecyclerView.</li>
      </ul>
